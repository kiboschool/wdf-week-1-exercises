  <h3>Rooibos Tea</h3>
  <p class="description">Rooibos tea is made from the leaves of "red bush" plant, growing only in the Cederberg region of South Africa. It's often called "red tea" or "red bush" tea because of the bright red coloring the leaves take on during the oxidation and fermentation processes. A properly brewed cup of rooibos tea will be a rich red color and have a sweet, nutty flavor.</p>

    <li>Original Rooibos</li>
    <li>Rooibos Mint</li>

  <h3>Herbal Tea</h3>
  <p class="description">
    While they aren't made from the same plant as the other teas, we still love them! Herbal teas are usually made from parts of plants like the leaves, stem, or flower buds, and prepared by steeping them in boiling water, like other teas.
