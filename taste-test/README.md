# Practice: Link the Stylesheet

This page is supposed to have a funny little emojis that change when you click the buttons. But when you click the button, nothing happens!

Add the script tag with the right `src` attribute to link the `script.js` file to the page.

## Steps

* Click 'Run' to see the webpage without the JavaScript file active
* Add the script tag to the end of the `<body>` of `index.html`
* Run the code to see what the script does

If you like, you can also read the contents of `script.js` to see how it works. You don't have to know what any of it means yet.
